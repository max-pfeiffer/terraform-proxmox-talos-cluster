# Proxmox Talos OpenTofu Module
An [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) module which provisions a turnkey Kubernetes cluster with
[Talos Linux](https://www.talos.dev/) on a
[Proxmox VE hypervisor](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview).

Kubernetes cluster features:
* [Talos Linux v1.13.8](https://www.talos.dev/)
* Kubernetes v1.36.3
* no kube-proxy
* [Cilium v1.20.0](https://cilium.io/) as Container Network Interface (CNI)
  * without kube-proxy
  * with [L2 loadbalancer support](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/l2-announcements/)
  * with [Ingress controller support](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/ingress/) (optional)
  * with [Gateway API support](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/servicemesh/gateway-api/gateway-api/)
  * with [Egress gateway support](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/egress-gateway/egress-gateway/)
* [Gateway API v1.6.1](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) CRDs (standard channel) are installed (optional)
* control plane nodes share a [virtual IP](https://www.talos.dev/v1.13/talos-guides/network/vip/) as Kubernetes API endpoint
* Talos OS and Kubernetes upgrades are handled declaratively, see [Upgrading](#upgrading)

The module creates one virtual machine per node, downloads the Talos Linux ISO image to every Proxmox node which hosts
a virtual machine, applies the Talos machine configuration, bootstraps the cluster and returns `kubeconfig` and
`talosconfig`.

## Requirements
* [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) >= 1.11.0
* A Proxmox VE API token with permissions to manage virtual machines, storage and downloads
* A Talos Linux image with the [QEMU guest agent extension](https://github.com/siderolabs/extensions/tree/main/guest-agents/qemu-guest-agent),
  build one with the [Talos Linux Image Factory](https://factory.talos.dev/) (platform `nocloud`)

## Usage
The module does not configure any providers. Configure the [bpg/proxmox](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest/docs)
provider in your root module, the `siderolabs/talos` and `hashicorp/helm` providers need no configuration:
```hcl
provider "proxmox" {
  endpoint  = "https://192.168.1.25:8006/"
  api_token = "${var.proxmox_api_token_id}=${var.proxmox_api_token_secret}"
  insecure  = true
}

module "talos_cluster" {
  source  = "max-pfeiffer/talos-cluster/proxmox"
  version = "0.1.0" # x-release-please-version

  proxmox_target_node    = "your-proxmox-node"
  proxmox_storage_device = "local-lvm"

  talos_version      = "1.13.8"
  kubernetes_version = "1.36.3"

  cluster_name          = "your-cluster-name"
  cluster_vip_shared_ip = "192.168.10.100"

  network             = "192.168.10.0/24"
  network_gateway     = "192.168.10.1"
  domain_name_servers = ["192.168.10.1"]

  node_data = {
    controlplanes = {
      "192.168.10.101" = {
        install_disk  = "/dev/vda"
        install_image = "factory.talos.dev/nocloud-installer/ce4c980550dd2ab1b17bbf2b08801c7eb59418eafe8f279833297925d67c7515:v1.13.8"
        hostname      = "your-cluster-name-cp-0"
      }
    }
    workers = {
      "192.168.10.102" = {
        install_disk  = "/dev/vda"
        install_image = "factory.talos.dev/nocloud-installer/ce4c980550dd2ab1b17bbf2b08801c7eb59418eafe8f279833297925d67c7515:v1.13.8"
        hostname      = "your-cluster-name-worker-0"
      }
    }
  }
}

output "kubeconfig" {
  value     = module.talos_cluster.kubeconfig
  sensitive = true
}
```
The module is also available directly from GitHub, e.g. for unreleased changes:
`source = "git::https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/terraform-proxmox-talos-cluster.git?ref=v0.1.0"`. <!-- x-release-please-version -->

Nodes in `node_data` are keyed by their IPv4 address. `hostname`, `cpu_cores`, `memory` (MB), `disk_size` (GB) and
`proxmox_node` are optional per node. The `hostname` is also used as virtual machine name. Without a `hostname` Talos
Linux generates one itself and the virtual machine is named `<cluster_name>-control-plane-<ip>` or
`<cluster_name>-worker-<ip>`, e.g. `your-cluster-name-worker-192-168-10-102`. Without a `proxmox_node` the virtual
machine is created on `proxmox_target_node`.

The control plane node with the lowest IP address is used to bootstrap the cluster, run Kubernetes upgrades and
retrieve the kubeconfig. It is chosen once on creation, adding control plane nodes later does not change it. If you
remove that node, move this role to another control plane node:
```shell
tofu apply -replace=module.talos_cluster.talos_cluster.this -replace=module.talos_cluster.talos_cluster_kubeconfig.this
```

Complete examples are in the [examples](https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/terraform-proxmox-talos-cluster/tree/main/examples) directory:
* [basic](https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/terraform-proxmox-talos-cluster/tree/main/examples/basic): one control plane and one worker node
* [advanced](https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/terraform-proxmox-talos-cluster/tree/main/examples/advanced): highly available control plane spread across a Proxmox cluster, VLAN,
  config patches for registry mirrors and additional Cilium Helm values

Apply the configuration and grab the kube config file:
```shell
$ tofu init
$ tofu apply
$ tofu output -raw kubeconfig > ~/.kube/config
$ chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                          STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
your-cluster-name-cp-0        Ready    control-plane   5d    v1.36.3
your-cluster-name-worker-0    Ready    <none>          5d    v1.36.3
```
You might need to wait a bit until the nodes come up.

## Upgrading
Talos OS and Kubernetes versions are managed declaratively through the
[terraform-provider-talos](https://github.com/siderolabs/terraform-provider-talos) v0.12.0 resources:

* `talos_machine` owns each node's machine configuration and its Talos OS version. On every
  `tofu plan`/`apply` the provider reads the running Talos version, the active Image Factory
  schematic and the applied machine configuration hash from the node and reconciles any drift.
* `talos_cluster` bootstraps etcd and owns the Kubernetes version. Changing its `kubernetes_version`
  runs Talos' `upgrade-k8s` procedure, which pre-pulls images and upgrades kube-apiserver,
  kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, kube-proxy and the kubelets sequentially with health
  gating.

Gracefully orchestrating in-place upgrades through Terraform/OpenTofu has long been a rough edge in
the Talos provider — see [siderolabs/terraform-provider-talos#140](https://github.com/siderolabs/terraform-provider-talos/issues/140)
for the multi-year discussion on graceful, node-by-node upgrades.

### Upgrading Talos
1. Pick the new Talos version and update `talos_linux_iso_image_url` and
   `talos_linux_iso_image_filename`.
2. For every node in `node_data`, update `install_image` to the matching version tag, e.g.
   `factory.talos.dev/nocloud-installer/<schematic-id>:v1.14.0`. The schematic ID stays the same
   across versions unless you change the extensions baked into the image on the
   [Talos Image Factory](https://factory.talos.dev/); only the version tag needs bumping.
   `install_image` alone drives the OS upgrade.
3. Leave `talos_version` alone. It is the *machine configuration contract*, pinned to the version the
   cluster was created with, and is independent of the installed Talos version — the provider's docs
   make this [explicit](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/siderolabs/talos/latest/docs/data-sources/machine_configuration)
   as of v0.12.0. Bumping it regenerates every node's machine configuration with the new contract's
   schema and defaults, which is a separate, deliberate action, not part of a routine OS upgrade.
4. Run `tofu plan` to confirm only the `image` field (and any machine config drift) is changing, not
   disk layout or network settings.
5. Control plane and worker nodes are each applied with `for_each` and have no `depends_on` chaining
   between individual nodes, so a plain `tofu apply` upgrades every node in parallel. For a
   multi-control-plane cluster this risks losing etcd quorum. Run `tofu apply -parallelism=1` instead
   to upgrade nodes one at a time — see the provider's
   [Upgrading multiple nodes safely](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/siderolabs/talos/latest/docs/resources/machine#upgrading-multiple-nodes-safely)
   guidance.
6. `drain_on_upgrade` is `true` for all `talos_machine` resources, so each node is cordoned and
   drained before it reboots and uncordoned afterwards. The kubeconfig needed for that is derived
   offline from the machine secrets by an ephemeral `talos_cluster_kubeconfig` resource, which keeps it
   free of a dependency cycle with `talos_machine` and out of the state. Draining requires a healthy
   Kubernetes cluster, so keep the ISO version and `install_image` in step (1)/(2) in sync: an upgrade
   that fires during the *initial* bring-up, before Kubernetes exists, would fail on the drain.

### Upgrading Kubernetes
1. Update `kubernetes_version`.
2. The value feeds both `talos_cluster` and the generated machine configuration. `talos_cluster`
   performs the actual rolling upgrade via `upgrade-k8s`; the machine configuration only controls the
   image tags baked into it, which matter at bootstrap when a node is added later, so the two must stay
   in sync — a single variable feeds both.
3. All `talos_machine` resources set `ignore_kubernetes_upgrade_drift = true`, so the five
   Kubernetes component image fields owned by `upgrade-k8s` (`machine.kubelet.image`,
   `cluster.apiServer.image`, `cluster.controllerManager.image`, `cluster.scheduler.image`,
   `cluster.proxy.image`) are excluded from `talos_machine`'s drift detection. Without it,
   `tofu apply` would re-apply those tags directly and in parallel across all nodes, bypassing
   `upgrade-k8s`'s sequencing. Note that the attribute is flagged experimental by the provider: only
   the version tag is stripped from the hash, so a registry change is still detected as drift.
4. A plain `tofu apply` is safe here — `talos_cluster` does the sequencing and health gating itself,
   so `-parallelism=1` is not needed for this step.

## Versioning
The module follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), releases are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and created by
[release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).
While the module is below `1.0.0`, breaking changes bump the minor version and everything else the patch version.
Pin the module to an exact `version` and read the [changelog](https://github.com/max-pfeiffer/terraform-proxmox-talos-cluster/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) before upgrading.

A change is breaking (`feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer) if it changes infrastructure that existing users get
on their next `tofu apply` without touching their configuration, in particular:
* changing the default of any version input, e.g. `cilium_version`, `talos_linux_iso_image_url` or the bundled
  Gateway API CRDs
* removing or renaming inputs or outputs, adding required inputs or changing their types
* changing resource addresses without `moved` blocks
* raising the minimum OpenTofu or provider versions

## Development
Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/),
[TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint) and [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/), e.g. on macOS:
```shell
brew install uv opentofu terraform-docs terraform-linters/tap/tflint
```
TFLint is not available in Homebrew's core repository, it is installed from the
[official TFLint tap](https://github.com/terraform-linters/homebrew-tap). For other platforms see the
[TFLint installation instructions](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint#installation).

Sync dependencies and install the git hooks:
```shell
uv sync
uv run pre-commit install
```
The hooks format and lint the code, generate the inputs and outputs in this README, lint the GitHub workflows and check
commit messages and pushed commits for secrets.

Commit messages and pull request titles must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/),
both are checked in CI. Pull requests are squash merged with their title as commit message.

Validate and test the module, the tests use mocked providers and need neither Proxmox nor a Talos cluster:
```shell
tofu init -backend=false
tofu validate
tofu test
```
